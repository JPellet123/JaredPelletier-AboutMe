My Name is Jared Pelletier, a competent programmer who likes to problem solve. I was first introduced
into coding in highschool with some very basic python, after that I dabbled in java but then covid
happened. That setback made me want to learn even more and lead me to applying into the course Information Technologyy Programmer Analyst.
Throughout my college career I completed a plethora of programs that trained me in a few different languages (Java, Javascript, C#, PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL) as 
well as giving me knowledge in quite a few soft skills as well. (Interpersonal Communications, Applied Writing etc)
